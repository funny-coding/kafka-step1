This code contains examples for a kafka producer / consumer  in java and scala.

In the Java example we push a message in a kafka topic and then  comsume it.

In the Scala example we generate some instances of an object Log() and push them in a kafka topic
and then calculate the number of logs grouped by date and level in a kafka consumer.
